# Extensions 

Extensions in Basalt are additional files that can be added to the framework to extend the functionality of specific classes or the Basalt foundation itself. These extension files allow you to enhance or customize the behavior of elements without directly modifying the core framework code. All of these extensions are optional, non of them are required for basalt to work.
