# Introduction to Basalt

Welcome to Basalt, a dedicated UI framework tailored for the ComputerCraft environment. At its core, Basalt's primary goal is to simplify and streamline the process of creating user interfaces within ComputerCraft's unique landscape.

## What is Basalt?

Basalt is a set of tools and utilities that, when combined, provides a foundation for building interactive applications within the ComputerCraft universe. Instead of starting from scratch each time you want to craft an interface, Basalt offers a collection of pre-designed components like buttons, sliders, and text fields.

## The Strengths of Basalt

- **Performance:** One of Basalt's defining attributes is its performance capabilities. Designed with optimization in mind, it ensures your applications run smoothly.
- **Complexity Handled:** With Basalt, creating complex applications doesn't mean starting complex. The framework provides a scaffold upon which you can build, handling many of the nitty-gritty details, so you can focus on your application's unique needs.

## When to Use (or Not Use) Basalt

Basalt shines brightest when your project requires a refined, interactive user interface. If you're aiming to build applications that are complex and interactive, Basalt is your go-to.

However, for very basic projects, say, an application with a singular function and a single button, you might find that integrating a whole framework like Basalt may be more than you need. Always evaluate the scope and requirements of your project before diving in.

## Behind the Scenes

Without getting too technical right out of the gate, it's worth noting that Basalt operates by managing a series of event listeners and handlers. This means, in the background, it's continuously listening for user interactions and responding in real-time. This dynamic approach is part of what allows Basalt to offer such a responsive and interactive user experience.
