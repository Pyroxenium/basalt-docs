This guide will provide an overview of Basalt, its main components, and the basic concepts and terminology used in the framework.</p><h2 id="main-components-of-basalt" tabindex="-1">Main Components of Basalt <a class="header-anchor" href="#main-components-of-basalt" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Main Components of Basalt&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Basalt consists of several key components that work together to create a seamless user interface experience. Some of the main components include:</p><ol><li><p>Objects: Basalt objects represent the various UI elements that make up an application’s interface. Examples of objects include frames, buttons, text fields, and more. Each object comes with a set of properties and methods that allow you to customize its appearance and behavior.</p></li><li><p>Frames: Frames are the primary containers for organizing and laying out UI objects in Basalt. They can be nested, allowing for complex and hierarchical layouts. Basalt provides different types of frames, such as basic frames, movable frames, scrollable frames, and flexboxes, each with their own unique properties and use cases.</p></li><li><p>Events: Events are triggered by user interactions, such as clicks, keypresses, and other inputs. Basalt provides an event handling system that allows you to easily respond to these events and update your application’s interface or behavior accordingly.</p></li><li><p>Threading: Basalt supports the use of threads in applications, enabling concurrent actions and background processes to run without blocking the main program.</p></li></ol><p>This introduction should give you a basic understanding of Basalt and its main components. As you continue to explore the framework and its features, you’ll gain a deeper understanding of how to create and customize your own applications.</p>',6),i=[s];function r(c,l,d,p,u,h){return a(),t("div",null,i)}const b=e(n,[["render",r]]);export{f as __pageData,b as default};
