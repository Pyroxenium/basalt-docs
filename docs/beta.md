# Basalt 2 Beta

Welcome to the Basalt 2 Beta! This page serves as a temporary hub for information. During this period, Basalt 2 is available for testing and feedback while I work on resolving any remaining bugs and issues.

The beta phase will last around 1 month, longer if it's necessary. While the beta phase is active, both, basalt 1 and basalt 2 will exist. After the Beta phase is done, and i feel like basalt 2 is polished enough, i'd like to archive basalt 1 and make basalt 2 the new default. Don't worry i'll try to keep the old docs alive.

You can download Basalt [here](guides/download), and [here](guides/getting-started) is a link to the getting-started page. The API can be found [here](references/main).

## What's new?

Basalt 2 represents a significant evolution from its predecessor. Here are some of the key improvements and features:

### Complete Rewrite

Basalt 2 is a complete rewrite of the Basalt framework. The codebase has been redesigned from the ground up to be more readable, maintainable, and logical. This rewrite was necessary due to the accumulation of features in Basalt 1, which made the codebase unwieldy and difficult to manage, resulting in unexpected bugs.

### Property System

One of the major features of Basalt 2 is the introduction of a dynamic property system. All elements and their properties are now based on this system, providing greater flexibility and consistency in customization.

### Error Handling

Basalt 2 includes a robust error handling system, making it easier to identify and diagnose errors. Previously, errors were difficult to detect and understand, but with Basalt 2, error messages are clear and informative, helping developers troubleshoot more effectively.

### Improved Elements

Many elements in Basalt 2 have been enhanced and their usage streamlined for improved usability. 

### Other things

Additionally, annotations have been added to simplify programming in the editor, and performance optimizations have been implemented to ensure smoother operation.

## Why Basalt 2?

The decision to create Basalt 2 stemmed from the need for a cleaner, more efficient framework. Basalt 1 became increasingly complex over time, making it challenging to maintain and extend. With Basalt 2, I aimed to address these issues from the outset, resulting in a more cohesive and user-friendly framework.

## Future of Basalt 2

After the release of Basalt 2, I will not be introducing any new features. My primary focus will be on addressing existing bugs and improving performance. There are no new elements planned, nor are there any additional features in the pipeline. This decision has been made to maintain consistency in Basalt 2 and ensure that there are no sudden issues arising from updates after the release. The release version of Basalt 2 will remain the core version, and there will be no further updates.

However, this does not mean that I will never introduce anything new again. Given that Basalt is highly modular, I will be adding new elements in a separate GitHub repository (basaltadditions) when I have the time. These elements can be installed additionally but are not related to the core version of Basalt 2.

## Get Involved

Your feedback is invaluable during the beta phase of Basalt 2. Please take the time to test the framework, report any bugs or issues you encounter, and provide suggestions for improvements. Together, we can make Basalt 2 the best it can be!
